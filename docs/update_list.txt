04/08/25    - Change the avl_tree to be sorted by cumulative_travel_time rather
              than travel_duration. Following this, change the travel_duration
              parameter in insert() (avl_tree.py) and Node() (node.py) to
              cumulative_travel_time.
            - Change next_stop_in_trip() (stop_db.py) to
              get_all_following_stops_in_trip(). It now retrieves all following
              stops rather than only the next stop.
