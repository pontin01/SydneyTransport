04/08/25    - Change the avl_tree to be sorted by cumulative_travel_time rather
              than travel_duration. Following this, change the travel_duration
              parameter in insert() (avl_tree.py) and Node() (node.py) to
              cumulative_travel_time.
            - Change next_stop_in_trip() (stop_db.py) to
              get_all_following_stops_in_trip(). It now retrieves all following
              stops rather than only the next stop.

07/08/25    - Created Verbose mode. In this mode all Stop names are printed as
              they are searched. A complete print out of all Stops in the final
              connection is printed out. Verbose mode is triggered by the
              command line argument "-v".
            - Created final travel instructions which tell the user which stop
              they should get to, at what time they should get there, what
              Route they should take (e.g. bus/train line), and where to get
              off.

08/08/25    - Moved static functions in search.py to search_utils.py.
            - Now checks for typos and suggests alternative StopNames if the
              entered start and end StopName doesn't match any StopNames.
